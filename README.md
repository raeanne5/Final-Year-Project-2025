# Final-Year-Project-2025
This is Raeanne Ng Wei Xin's Final Year Project code on Machine Learning Approaches for Credit Card Fraud Detection.

This repository contains the files and models used for my undergraduate final year project on Predictive Analysis for Detecting Credit Card Fraud.

Two datasets are explored:

1. Ideal Dataset (Balanced):
An ideal dataset where the number of fraudulent and legitimate transactions are equal. This dataset is used to compare the results of a more realistic dataset and the performance of Logistic Regression in this scenario is evaluated.

2. Realistic Dataset (Imbalanced):
A more realistic dataset reflecting real-world scenario where there is actual class imbalance in credit card transactions, as fraudulent cases represent a very small fraction of the total transactions. This dataset is used to explore and compare:

Logistic Regression (without SMOTE)

Logistic Regression (with SMOTE)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Each model is evaluated based on classification metrics such as Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
